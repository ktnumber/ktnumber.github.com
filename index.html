											<h2>Welcome to KT Number</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Are you interested in timing the stock market? Are you tired of investment advisers telling you that "buy and hold" is the way to go, only to see your investment capital go down by 30-40% in bear markets? Are you tired of paying a “professional” 2-3% of your total account value each year whether your account grew or not? Are you looking for a do-it-yourself method of investing for your own retirement?</p>
										<p>Well you've come to the right place. My proprietary market timing service, the KT Number, does just that, time the market. Back-tested to 1971, the KT Number has earned a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.47% timing the NASDAQ index and a 20.16% compounded annual growth rate timing the Russell 2000 index since its inception in 1987. You can see all of our yearly returns on the Historical Results page.</p>
										<p>The KT Number is designed to be used in conjunction with leveraged ETFs to time the market by avoiding market crashes and staying in during bull market runs.</p>
										<p>For a monthly fee of only $30.00 or an annual fee of $300 you can subscribe to my stock market timing service. Included in the service is access to each day's KT Number and what signal (Buy or Sell) we are on currently. You will also receive 2 emails per week updating you on what the KT Numbers are for each day of that week. Furthermore, the day a signal change is given by the KT Number, you will receive an email alert telling you when to get in and out of the stock market.</p>

											<h2>KT Number Explained</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I am sure you realize that what goes into the KT Number is proprietary. Each day I mathematically calculate a number that represents the trend of the market for that day. The metric is cumulative so you will be able to see the trend developing. I do this for the NASDAQ and the Russell 2000. As a subscriber, I will be sending you a newsletter every Monday and Wednesday, which shows you the readings for every day in that week. When the KT Number issues a buy or sell signal I will send you an e-mail on that day. That way you can go ahead and enter your buy or sell order for the next day’s market open. For the KT Number, I need to see a reading of positive .2% of the market’s close to get a buy signal and negative .2% of the market’s close to get a sell signal. This is for the NASDAQ as well as the Russell 2000. At today’s market levels this would be equal to around a + or – 30 for the NASDAQ and a + or – 4 for the Russell 2000.</p>
										<p>When I issue a buy signal on the NASDAQ, for example, the KT Number can go as high as it wants. I’ve seen it go as high as +64 in a very powerful sustained up market, like back in the dot com bubble of early 2000. It can also go just as low after a sell signal. I’ve seen it go as low as -122 in a bearish market crash, like when the dot com bubble burst in 2000.</p>
										<p>But we do not sell or buy until the KT Number tells us to. This is very important because we have seen it get very close to sell signal levels and then rebound. So it acts as a filter to avoid frequent unnecessary signals.</p>
										<p>Since 1971, the KT Number has averaged 3 buys and sells per year, so it identifies intermediate trends. You can see the historical results here. Note the number of signals each year and particularly note the number of days that you would have been in and out of the market. If you are familiar with any good or bad years, you will see that the KT Number keeps us in up markets, and more importantly, keeps us out of major drops in the market. This is the main goal of the KT Number; capital preservation. Trend following does not get any better than this. While the market is going down, you are on the sideline not losing your hard earned capital and while the market is going up you’ve got your capital at work.</p>
										<p>You can also see that not every year is a good year. This is to be expected. There is no system out there that makes money on every trade. If someone tells you this, you need to run the other way. Since 1971, there have been 12 years that we have lost money on the NASDAQ. This is about 1 in 4. However, you’ll notice that the most we lost in one year was 27% and most losing years were less than 10%. Compare this to the most we gained in one year of 169% and most winning years were around the 60% mark. This is just another reflection of staying in with a winning trade and cutting the loss short when a trade goes against us.</p>

											<h2>How It Works</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I developed the KT Number to time the market after years of market research, technical analysis and much back testing. This is the number that is available exclusively to subscribers. Each day the KT Number converts the stock market action into a number that represent the trend of the market.</p>
										<p>A buy signal for the NASDAQ is triggered when the KT Number reaches a reading of positive .2% of that day’s market close and a sell signal when a reading of negative .2% is reached. At today’s NASDAQ levels of around 15,000, the reading would need to be around positive 30 for a buy and a negative 30 for a sell.</p>
										<p>Similarly, a buy signal for the Russell 2000 is triggered when the KT Number reaches a reading of positive .2% of that day’s market close and a sell signal when a reading of negative .2% is reached. At today’s Russell 2000 levels of around 2000, the reading would need to be around positive 4 for a buy and a negative 4 for a sell.</p>
										<p>When a buy signal is given by the KT Number, the next morning is buy time. I go in that night and put in my order to be executed on the market open. You then stay in until a sell signal is given. At that time, you sell on the next day’s open just like you did when you bought and wait for another buy signal to be given. It’s that simple and because the readings are mathematical and precise, there is no need to try to use subjective interpretations. No emotion is involved. Never again stay too long in a major decline because you are hoping the market comes back up or miss a major up move because you fear that it’s too late to get in. The KT Number mathematics makes that impossible. It forces you to take action.</p>
										<h3>I don't handle your money, you do.</h3>
										<p>You run your own account, whether it is an IRA, ROTH IRA, individual trading account, etc. We notify you by email when buy or sell signals are generated. That way you can put your order in for the market open the next day. This is perfect for do-it-yourself investors. You don’t need investment advisers that charge a certain percentage of the account value. You only have to follow what the KT Number tells you to do for your own retirement account.</p>
										<p>We use the Exchange Traded Fund, TQQQ, for trading the NASDAQ market and the Exchange Traded Fund, TNA, for trading the Russell 2000 market. These are leveraged ETFs that seek daily investment results that correspond to three times (3x) the daily performance of the respective market. For example, NASDAQ goes up 1% on the day; TQQQ goes up 3%. NASDAQ goes down 1% on the day; TQQQ goes down 3%, etc. This allows you to maximize your return during the big bull markets.</p>

						<!-- KT Number About Market Timing -->
						<section id="market_timing" class="main">

									<header>
										<h2>About Market Timing</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>There are two basic concepts in timing the market:</h3>
									<ol>
										<li>Take small losses.</li>
										<li>Stay in the winners for the big gain.</li>
									</ol>
									<h3>Take a loss:</h3>
									<p>Human nature makes people tend to stay with a losing investment and hope that it will go back up. Instead, take the small loss and preserve your capital for the next buying opportunity. The KT Number recognizes when the trend has changed and issues a sell signal long before you are in over your head with a huge loss.</p>
									<h3>Staying in for the big gain:</h3>
									<p>Often times people will make a good investment only to sell it and lock in their gains when they are up 10%. They then see it continue on for maybe a 40-50% gain and kick themselves the whole way up for not staying in for the ride. The KT Number keeps you in for the long haul and will get you out near the top of all major market runs.</p>
									<p>Some people may say that they are in for the long term, and there is nothing wrong with that. However, the market doesn’t always go up and if you stay in these vicious bear markets, it could take years before you get back to even on your investment. Using the KT Number ensures that you get out before major downtrends occur so you can preserve your capital and live to invest another day when the market turns back up. In fact the KT Number has avoided every major drop in the market since 1971. Is this due to luck? No, just good market timing.</p>
									<h3>A prolonged up market can outperform market timing:</h3>
									<p>This is a true statement and over certain portions of history, you could have made more money staying in during a prolonged up market instead of trying to time the market. However, you only know this because you have all the data in front of you now, but you didn’t then. It’s impossible to get in at the exact bottom or out at the exact top. Hindsight is 20/20. Over time, using the KT Number to time the market, and your investment decisions, will outperform the general market tremendously because the market doesn’t just go up all the time. There are big drops now and then that it keeps you out of.</p>
									<h3>Are my signals perfect?</h3>
									<p>Of course not. But since 1971, 3 out of every 4 years on the NASDAQ and 2 out of every 3 years on the Russell 2000 have yielded positive results using the KT Number. Yes, we occasionally make trades that result in small losses, but that is the key, small losses. You have to be able to come to grips that losses are going to happen. The gains, however, can be very large, because we stay with the uptrend for as long as it runs and they more than make up for the losses incurred.</p>

										<h2>Emotions</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>There are four human emotions that have and always will control what goes on in the stock market:</h3>
									<h3>Hope</h3>
									<p>Holding losing investments, hoping they will come back up so that you can break even. Hoping that your losing investment will come back because you are a long term investor and you have time. The time that you are holding that investment hoping it will eventually come back is wasted time. You could have sold the stock after a small loss and used that money towards another purchase that would have resulted in a potential big gain.</p>
									<h3>Fear</h3>
									<p>Many investors let fear control how they make their investment decisions. Fearful that the unrealized gain they have will be gone tomorrow so they sell at the first sign of weakness. Afraid that the market will leave them behind, so they feel they have to pick the bottom or get in before an uptrend has confirmed itself. Afraid of losing their hard earned capital and hesitating to buy after a vicious bear market, when they should be listening to what the market is telling them and buying.</p>
									<h3>Pride</h3>
									<p>Not admitting when you are wrong. In investing, you are going to make some wrong decisions. Nobody is right 100% of the time. You have to be able to admit you made a bad investment and get out early enough to limit your losses. However, this is hard. No one wants to admit they are wrong and when this happens in investing, you end up with an investment that has lost you a lot of money.</p>
									<h3>Greed</h3>
									<p>After a couple of consecutive winning trades, investors start feeling invincible, like they’ve got it all figured out. This is greed creeping in. They start entering other trades that they might not have before because now they think they know more than the market. The investment moves just like they thought it was and they get greedy and add on more money. It moves past the target price but greed has overtaken them and they hold on “knowing” that it’s going to continue upwards. The investment then starts coming back down but they hold on “knowing” this is just a short correction. Soon the big gain has turned into a loss and Fear takes over. This is the Greed and Fear cycle that is always present in the market.</p>
									<p>Once you can eliminate these emotions from your investment decisions, you are on your way to becoming a successful investor. This is where the KT Number comes into play. It removes all emotions from your investment decisions. If the KT Number says buy, you buy. When the KT Number says sell, you sell. It’s that simple. No holding on one more day because you are greedy. No selling after a 2 point gain because you are fearful the market is going to turn down tomorrow. No hoping that a losing investment comes back to even because you don’t want to take the 40% loss. No swallowing your pride because you were wrong once again in your investment decision. Let the KT Number guide you on when to get in and out of the market.</p>
